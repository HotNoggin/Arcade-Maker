# Kibiboy

 A mini engine made for arcade-style games.
 A "tiny" project that I am making to learn SDL.



## Requirements

This application uses a few libraries. You'll want to install them if you plan to build the application from source. These are the versions of these libraries used in the most recent development build. You can use other versions if they are supported.

- SDL 2.30.5 (2.30.x+ recommended) - [Download binaries or source code from release](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.5).

- Lua 5.4.2 (5.4.x+ recommended) - [Download binaries](https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.4.2/), or [Download source code (lua-5.4.2.tar.gz)](https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.2.tar.gz).
